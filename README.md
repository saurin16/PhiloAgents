# üß† PhiloAgents ‚Äì AI-Powered Conversational Philosophers

**PhiloAgents** is a simulation engine that brings history‚Äôs greatest philosophers to life using Large Language Models and agentic AI patterns. Built using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **FastAPI**, **Groq**, and **WebSockets**, it transforms static NPCs into dynamic, reasoning AI agents like Plato, Aristotle, and Turing.

Created as part of a hands-on course in collaboration with **Decoding ML** and **The Neural Maze**, this project combines game development, LLM engineering, and agent simulation in a production-ready system.

## üéÆ What It Does

- Simulates deep, evolving conversations with AI agents embodying real philosophers
- Uses **agentic RAG patterns** and **character memory** for realism and contextual continuity
- Provides a fully functional **REST API** using FastAPI
- Supports **real-time chat via WebSockets**
- Includes **LLMOps tools** for prompt monitoring, evaluation, and debugging
- Structured for **production deployment** with Docker and cloud tools

## üß† Agents You Can Talk To

- **Plato** ‚Äì Discusses justice, metaphysics, and idealism
- **Aristotle** ‚Äì Explains ethics, logic, and causality
- **Alan Turing** ‚Äì Talks about computation, AI, and consciousness

Each agent is trained on vectorized knowledge from sources like **Wikipedia** and the **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy**, and enhanced using **agentic memory (short + long-term)** and prompt engineering.
